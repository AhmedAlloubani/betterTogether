//	Create a class named "House";
//	 * 	- Within that class create:
//	 * 		- static variable counter;
//	 * 		- non-static variable houseNumber;
//	 * 		- all the other non-static relevant data points as variables;
//	 * 		- constructor that increments counter by 1 and assigns the incremented value to houseNumber;
//	 * 		- getters and setters;
//	 * 		- toString method that returns all the info about this Particular house
//	 * 	- Create a class named "Development_Site";
//	 * 	- Build 5 houses on the development site;
//	 * 	- Check if the houseNumber and counter have been assigned correctly.
	
	
	
//	Create a class Test_Automation;
//	Create 4 overloaded methods buildTeam() - all are public static void;
//	first - accepts no parameters and prints "Unknown number of random people following no development methodologies";
//	second - accepts one int numOfPeople and prints numOfPeople + " students following no development methodologies";
//	third - accepts two parameters: int numOfPeople, String methodology and prints numOfPeople + " students following " + methodology + " methodology";
//	fourth - accepts three parameters: int numOfPeople, String position, String methodology and prints numOfPeople + " " + position + " following " + methodology + " methodology";
//	Create a class Batch2;
//	Statically import all the methods from the class Test_Automation;
//	Extract the value from the String[] args and convert it to an int using the following code: int month = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
//	Set up a switch statement that accepts int month as a key-value;
//	Switch statement should call:
//	the second overloaded method with numOfPeople = 26 if the value of the month is 0-2;
//	the third overloaded method with the parameters 26, "Agile" if the value of the month is 2-4;
//	the fourth overloaded method with the parameters 26, "SDETs", "Agile" if the value of the month is 4-6;
//	the first overloaded method in the default case;
//	Run the program by passing the argument through the Run Configuration menu in Eclipse;
//	Examine the output and troubleshoot if necessary.
