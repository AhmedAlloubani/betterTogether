	 * Arrays: 
	 * 	- is a container that can hold multiple values of a single type
	 * 	- int[] array = new int[5];
	 * 	- arays are a fixed size, once we create them, we can no longer change the number of elements that we store;
	 * 	- we can change the elements;
	 * 	- default values: same as instance variables.
	 * 	- array[0] = 6;
	 * 	- indexing within arrays start at 0;
	 * 	- the highest index in this case is 4;
	 * 	- array[5] = 7; this will compile, but it won't work and will throw an exception (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException)
